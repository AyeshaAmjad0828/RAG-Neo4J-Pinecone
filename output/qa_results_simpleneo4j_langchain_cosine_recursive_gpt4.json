        "The term of office for the President in the Federation of Pakistan is five years from the day he enters upon his office. Additionally, a person holding office as President is eligible for re-election to that office, but no person shall hold that office for more than two consecutive terms.\n",
        "The constitution being discussed in the text is that of Pakistan.\n",

        "The constitution secures child labor by prohibiting the engagement of children below the age of fourteen years in any factory, mine, or any other hazardous employment. It also ensures just and humane conditions of work, specifically stating that children and women should not be employed in vocations unsuited to their age or sex. Additionally, the constitution mandates the State to provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years, which indirectly supports the prevention of child labor by ensuring children are in school.\n\n"
