        " I will provide a brief answer to the question. If I don't have enough information or if the question is out of context, I will say so.       Here is my answer:       The Constitution of Pakistan is securing child labour by prohibiting the engagement of children below the age of 14 years in any factory or mine or any other hazardous employment. Article 11 of the Constitution specifically prohibits slavery, forced labor, etc., and ensures that children are not exploited in any way. The Constitution also ensures that compulsory service is not of a cruel nature or incompatible with human dignity. This means that children are protected from being forced to work in conditions that are harmful to their health, safety, and well-being. In addition, the Constitution ensures that no child can be punished for an act or omission that was not punishable by law at the time of the act or omission, which means that children are not held responsible for crimes that they may have committed as minors. Overall, the Constitution of Pakistan is securing child labour by ensuring that children are protected from exploitation and are given the opportunity to grow and develop in a safe and healthy environment.assistant    I couldn't find a good response to your query in the database.assistant    I apologize for the mistake.
